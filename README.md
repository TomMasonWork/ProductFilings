This notebook shows how to: 
- Get the data from Snowflake using the Python Snowflake Connector https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector
- Run SQL queries to create lookup tables for field values, like types of insurance and sub-types of insurance
- Pull approved rates data for a given line of business and data range (subscription required for access to advanced SQL query library)
